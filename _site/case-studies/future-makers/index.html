      <h2>My Role</h2>
<p>As the lead developer for this project, I was responsible for implementing key features that aligned with the client’s goals of improving content strategy and fostering educator relationships. My contributions included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog Development</strong> – Built a fully functional, SEO-optimized blog that the in-house team could easily update without requiring developer support.</li>
<li><strong>Membership System Creation</strong> – Designed and implemented an &quot;Educators' Portal&quot; for logged-in users to access exclusive content, including features such as email verification, password resets, and favoriting content.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Analytics &amp; Reporting</strong> – Developed a robust tracking system to separate member and non-member activity, providing actionable insights through a custom Google Analytics dashboard in Looker Studio.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>The project presented a unique set of challenges that required strategic problem-solving and technical execution:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User-Friendly Blog</strong><br>
Ensuring the blog was not only easy to update by the client’s non-technical in-house team but also optimized for SEO to improve content visibility and ranking.</li>
<li><strong>Membership System Complexity</strong><br>
Building a membership system with email verification, content gating, and user-specific features while maintaining a seamless experience for both logged-in and regular users.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Analytics Requirements</strong><br>
Writing custom code to track and segment user activity based on membership status and translating this data into meaningful reports for decision-makers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>A tailored approach was taken to address each challenge and deliver a high-performing solution:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SEO-Optimized Blog</strong><br>
Developed a blog that adhered to SEO best practices, including meta tags, structured data, and performance optimization, to enhance content visibility and search rankings.</li>
<li><strong>Feature-Rich Membership System</strong><br>
Built the Educators’ Portal with intuitive features such as account creation, email verification, password management, and a &quot;favorites&quot; system for saving educational guides.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Analytics &amp; Dashboard</strong><br>
Created a tracking system to separate member and non-member activity and visualized the data in a custom Looker Studio dashboard, providing insights into content engagement and user behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Process</h2>
<h3>Blog Development</h3>
<p>The blog was designed to align with the client’s inbound marketing strategy and ensure ease of use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content Management</strong><br>
Integrated a simple, intuitive CMS that allowed the in-house team to create, edit, and publish blog posts without technical support.</li>
<li><strong>SEO Optimization</strong><br>
Incorporated meta tags, alt text, and schema markup to ensure maximum visibility on search engines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Educators’ Portal</h3>
<p>The membership system was developed to foster deeper engagement with educators and provide exclusive access to valuable resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Features</strong><br>
Implemented email verification, password reset functionality, and a favorites system for saving content.</li>
<li><strong>Content Gating</strong><br>
Restricted certain pages and resources to logged-in members to encourage sign-ups and provide exclusive value.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Custom Analytics &amp; Dashboard</h3>
<p>To give the client actionable insights, I built a custom tracking and reporting solution:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traffic Segmentation</strong><br>
Used custom code to distinguish between logged-in and general user activity, allowing for detailed behavioral analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Looker Studio Dashboard</strong><br>
Designed a unified dashboard that visualized key metrics such as page views, content engagement, and user behavior for both members and non-members.</li>
</ul>
<p>By leveraging these solutions, the client was able to enhance their content strategy, build meaningful relationships with educators, and gain valuable insights into user behavior to inform future decisions.</p>
