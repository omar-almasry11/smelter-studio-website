## Service Overview

Startup Website Launch Sprints help startups and innovation teams rapidly move from problem identification to a copy-driven website optimized for conversions, and easy to update.

As a founder, you need a professional site that clearly communicates your vision, captures leads, and validates your concept—fast. You need someone to guide you through the process of creating a clear brand message, designing a conversion-focused website, and bringing that website to life. And that’s where I can help.

My Startup Marketing Website Sprint delivers an online presence that acts as a strategic tool to validate ideas and accelerate your growth.

## My Framework: From Idea to Launch

A proven process to help you turn your startup idea to a fully-functioning website that sends a clear message and generates leads.

### Phase 1: Discovery & Research

We start with a questionnaire to uncover your core message, target users, and goals. I’ll research competitors to help you position your idea in a way that stands out.

### Phase 2: Wireframing and Content Structure

Homepage and key pages laid out in low-fidelity wireframes. Draft conversion copy and key sections (hero, value props, social proof, CTA, FAQs).

### Phase 3: Visual Design

Translate approved wires into an on-brand design with usability and accessibility best practices.

### Phase 4: Development

Develop a responsive site with clean structure, performance optimizations, and CMS where needed.

### Phase 5: Launch, Onboarding, and Support

Cross-browser/device testing, basic SEO setup, go-live, and a short handover session so you can edit without code. Includes post-launch support for 14 that covers any bugs.

## What’s Included

- Custom copy and messaging honed for your audience
- 1-5 pages (e.g., homepage, features, about, contact) with lead capture
- Webflow CMS for effortless updates
