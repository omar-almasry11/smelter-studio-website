## Service Overview

Website Speed Optimization transforms slow, frustrating websites into lightning-fast experiences that keep visitors engaged and convert better. Whether your site is built on Webflow, WordPress, or any other platform, I'll identify performance bottlenecks and implement proven solutions to dramatically improve loading times.

Slow websites cost businesses millions in lost revenue. Studies show that even a 1-second delay in page load time can reduce conversions by 7%, and 40% of users abandon sites that take more than 3 seconds to load. If your website is slow, you're literally watching potential customers walk away.

My Website Speed Optimization service delivers measurable performance improvements that boost user experience, increase conversions, and improve search engine rankings.

## My Framework: From Slow to Lightning Fast

A systematic approach to identify, prioritize, and fix performance issues that are slowing down your website and costing you conversions.

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Speed Audit

I run detailed performance tests using industry-standard tools like PageSpeed Insights, GTmetrix, and WebPageTest to identify exactly what's slowing down your site. You'll receive a comprehensive audit report with prioritized recommendations.

### Phase 2: Image & Media Optimization

Images are often the biggest culprit in slow websites. I optimize all images using modern formats (WebP, AVIF), implement proper compression, and set up responsive images that load the right size for each device.

### Phase 3: Code & Resource Optimization

Clean up bloated code, remove unused CSS/JavaScript, implement critical CSS loading, and optimize third-party scripts. This includes minification, compression, and strategic resource loading.

### Phase 4: Caching & CDN Implementation

Set up advanced caching strategies and Content Delivery Network (CDN) configuration to serve your content from locations closest to your users, dramatically reducing load times globally.

### Phase 5: Performance Monitoring & Ongoing Optimization

Implement performance monitoring tools and provide recommendations for maintaining fast loading speeds as your site grows and evolves.
